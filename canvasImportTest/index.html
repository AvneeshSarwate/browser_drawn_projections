  <h1>Handwriting Canvas Component Demo</h1>
  <p class="instructions">
    This page demonstrates how to use the <code>&lt;handwriting-canvas&gt;</code> custom element alongside a
    simple inline p5.js sketch. Draw inside the canvas component and the p5 preview will mirror the baked
    stroke and polygon data supplied by the component's state updates (along with light animation driven py p5.js). 
    The canvas component defines a callback 
    function that will be called whenever the component's state updates, and provides the shape data from the canvas.
    You can also add metadata to individual shapes to annotate them however you want and use that data downstream.
    The example sketch shows how you can look for 'color' metadata on polygons to control their color in the p5.js drawing.
