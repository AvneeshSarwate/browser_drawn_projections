- clean up props vs internal state stuff
  - understand how/if vue props are converted to web component props - can they be dynamically modified? handle this
- will probably need various extra callbacks and externally exposed methods
  - newNotesSelected() callback so you can add extra ancilliary editors for note metadata 
- need to figure out proper focus handling for keybinding shortcuts
- figure out layer based multi-clip editting, like ableton?
- extensions 
  - ableton clip-view style clip organizer?
- add playNoteOnSelected and playNotesAtCursor callbacks like original
- mouseup doesn't release properly when dragged off canvas
