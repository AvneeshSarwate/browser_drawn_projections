- blur-effects shouldn't need a resolution uniform - should be able to automatically access uniform in function/shader
- double check that AI fixed layer blend is what you really want (probs not)
- need to be able to set default arguments for uniforms - (maybe have them as comments on the uniform buffer)
- need to fix api for multipass - maybe specify named ouputN texture args in functions (bloom example usage looks weird)
