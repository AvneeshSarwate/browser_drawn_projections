the folder src/sketches/handwriting_animator is a minimal canvas based drawing app using vue and konva. i am in the middle of a refactor to unify various functionalities. there are 2 main shape types, freehand shapes, and polygon shapes. there are 3 tool types, selection, freehand, and polygon. Freehand shapes have more functionality than polygon shapes. currently, i am trying to make a unified selection and transformation system that handles both types of shapes. i have a starting implementation, but it is broken 

the original freehand shape logic is defined in src/sketches/handwriting_animator/freehandTool_original.ts and the original outer app logic that delegates mouse events to the freehand tool is in src/sketches/handwriting_animator/LivecodeHolder_original.ts

these are methods in freehandTool_original of particular interest 
handleClick
freehandTopGroup
updateFreehandDraggableStates
groupSelectedStrokes
freehandLockPivot
freehandRefreshUI
startFreehandDragTracking
finishFreehandDragTracking
grpTr
selTr



the new selection and transformation logic is defined in several files in src/sketches/handwriting_animator/core

describe what is missing or wrong with the new implementation for a unified selection and transformation system
























> Here’s what’s off or missing in the new unified selection + transform system,
  with concrete pointers to where it shows up.

  Core Integration Gaps

  - Missing CanvasItem registration on load/clone:
      - Freehand: deserializeFreehandState attaches handlers but never registers
  items via fromStroke/fromGroup, so clicks/drag-select can’t find items in
  canvasItemRegistry (freehandTool.ts).
      - Polygons: deserializePolygonState attaches handlers but never
  fromPolygon(...) for pre‑existing shapes (polygonTool.ts).
      - Duplication: deepCloneWithNewIds updates maps but never registers cloned
  shapes/groups as CanvasItems; post-duplicate selection then fails.
  - Double selection handling:
      - Stage-level selection (core/selectTool) runs on mousedown, while node-
  level handlers use click and only call e.cancelBubble for click — both fire,
  toggling selection twice.
      - Node click handlers were changed to call selectionStore.toggle, but
  the stage handler still runs; unify to a single path (prefer stage tool) and
  remove node click-toggles (or block mousedown too).
  - No “top-group” escalation:
      - Original handleClick escalated path → topmost group via
  freehandTopGroup. The new select tool selects the exact node hit, allowing
  selecting a stroke inside a group, which breaks original invariants (e.g.,
  group-only transforms).
      - Either have selectTool escalate to the top group for freehand paths, or
  keep the old rule explicitly.

  Transformer Conflicts

  - Two transformers are active:
      - core/transformerManager.initializeTransformer adds a unified transformer
  to the selection layer.
      - LivecodeHolder.vue still constructs selTr (and freehandTool.ts can
  create grpTr inside freehandRefreshUI).
      - This creates conflicting/competing transformers. Drop the legacy selTr/
  grpTr/freehandRefreshUI path and rely solely on transformerManager.
  - Wrong layer scan for drag-select:
      - The select tool’s rectangle iterates all layers’ children and treats
  any Group as selectable; this can include Konva.Transformer groups in the
  selection layer. Filter out Konva.Transformer explicitly and/or limit to real
  shape layers.

  Undo/Redo Cohesion

  - Mixed history systems:
      - The new CommandStack captures unified state and is wired to
  onStateChange. Good for operations you wrapped with executeCommand.
      - Plain drags still use tool-specific trackers:
      - Freehand: node drag uses `startFreehandDragTracking/
  finishFreehandDragTracking` (freehand-only history).
      - Polygon: node and control-point drags use `startPolygonDragTracking/
  finishPolygonDragTracking` (polygon-only history).
  - Result: direct drags aren’t in the unified stack, so the unified Undo won’t
  undo those moves; also you now have two histories coexisting.
  - Fix: route node-level drags (dragstart/dragend) through the unified stack
  (similar to transformerManager’s transformstart/transformend), or expose a
  shared “start/finish transform tracking” helper for both tools and remove
  tool-local drag histories.

  Selection/UI State Drift

  - Legacy UI refs no longer update:
      - freehandSelectedCount, isFreehandGroupSelected, and freehandCanGroupRef
  are only updated in freehandRefreshUI, but that function isn’t called on
  selection changes anymore (now managed by selectionStore).
      - The toolbar buttons (group/ungroup/duplicate/delete) and the “X
  selected” label go stale.
      - Fix: watch selectionStore.selected (or selectedKonvaNodes) and recompute
  these refs there or in one central watch in LivecodeHolder.vue.
  - Timeline selection not kept in sync:
      - updateTimelineState builds selectedStrokesForTimeline, but it isn’t
  triggered by selectionStore changes. Tie it to selection changes so the
  Timeline reflects current selection immediately.

  Event/Behavior Mismatches vs. Original

  - Group pivot locking inconsistency:
      - The unified transformer does lock group pivot; however, the legacy
  grpTr/selTr path still exists and can reintroduce older behavior or conflicts.
  Remove legacy transformer management.
  - Draggability rules still tied to freehand draw mode:
      - updateFreehandDraggableStates uses freehandDrawMode and group
  membership; with the new top-level select/freehand/polygon tool, these rules
  should factor tool state consistently (e.g., draggable when select tool
  active, not dependent on freehand’s sub-mode).
  - Duplicate selection rectangles:
      - You initialize the select tool (core/selectTool.initializeSelectTool)
  and also call createSelectionRect() from freehandTool. That creates two
  rectangles on the selection layer; remove the legacy one.

  Smaller Issues

  - Visual highlight applies stroke/strokeWidth to paths/lines only; groups
  won’t show highlight except via transformer handles. That’s fine, but be aware
  of the UX.
  - Drag-select across all layers currently selects any Path/Line/Group. If you
  intend different hit policies for freehand vs polygons (e.g., polygon edit
  vs select), ensure mode checks gate which layers are scanned and how group
  escalation is handled.

  In short, the “unified” path is only partially wired. The biggest blockers
  are: missing CanvasItem registration on deserialization/clone, dual
  transformers, double selection event handling, non-escalated group selection,
  and drags not going through the unified command stack. Once those are
  addressed and selection-derived UI state is updated from the new store, both
  freehand and polygon selection/transform should behave consistently.
