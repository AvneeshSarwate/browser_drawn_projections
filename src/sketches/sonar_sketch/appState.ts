 * To fix this, when the barrier is resolved, we need to broadcast the 
 * current time to all of the channels that are waiting on the barrier.
 * they then adopt the broadcasted time as their current time.
 * This might require a refactor of the core time context logic to work. 
 * Additionally, will need to do another scripting-api/engine-api split. 
 * the in-browser api will just be barrierFunc("name") but the engine
 * function call will need to be barrierFunc("name", ctx) so that
 * the appropriate time context info can be used

  event orders per key - loop A is start/resolving barriers, loop B is awaiting to sync, imagine 1 beat loops

  startA - t-0
  resolA - t-1
  awaitB - t-1
  startA - t-1

  because of unpredictability of setTimeout, events at t-1 could happen in any order wrt wall clock

  All 6 possibilities:

  resolA - t-1
  awaitB - t-1
  startA - t-1
  - awaitB immediately releases becaues no active key and never waits on barrier 

  resolA - t-1
  startA - t-1
  awaitB - t-1
  - awaitB immediately releases because startTime == waitTime and never waits on barrier 

  startA - t-1
  resolA - t-1
  awaitB - t-1
  - awaitB immediately releases becaues no active key and never waits on barrier 

  startA - t-1
  awaitB - t-1
  resolA - t-1
  - awaitB immediately releases because startTime == waitTime and never waits on barrier 

  awaitB - t-1
  startA - t-1
  resolA - t-1
  - awaitB waits because it has captured and is waiting on barrier set at t-0, which never gets resolved when barrier map entry is overwritten with new start
  - FIX: if "double start" (eg, key as existing unresolved barrier when start is called), release it before creating new one

  awaitB - t-1
  resolA - t-1
  startA - t-1
  - awaitB releases because it's barrier is resolved
