I am a multimedia artist whose work lies at the intersection of music, realtime visuals, and interface design and interaction. I want to learn more about the history of artists working in this field. I am interested in artists in particular like John Whitney, who wrote about his own theories of how to correspond music and graphics in his book Digitial harmony. Other artist I am interested in are those like ryoji ikeda, Alva Noto, and Max Cooper, as they all combine some notions of music, graphics/animation, and conceptual systems linking the two. Relatedly, I am interested in the history of generative music composition, particularly for interactive generative music, and experimental interactive animation. Can you give me a history of artsits working at this intersection and the developments of these fields of art?








I am also interested in algorithmic music compositition, particualrly interactive generative music


history of interactive abstract animation and visual synthesis
